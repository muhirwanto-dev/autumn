<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Autumn

I built this web application to create a personal portfolio, feel free to use this project and publish with your own data.
The UI design is inspired from https://mattfarley.ca/ because I'm not a UI/UX designer.

This project created with .NET Blazor web app and use [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) for the User Interface.
